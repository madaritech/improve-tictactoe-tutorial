https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html

"If you have extra time or want to practice your new skills, here are some ideas for improvements you could make, listed in order of increasing difficulty:
* Display the move locations in the format “(1, 3)” in the move list.
* Bold the currently selected item in the move list.
* Rewrite Board to use two loops to make the squares instead of hardcoding them.
* Add a toggle button that lets you sort the moves in either ascending or descending order.
* When someone wins, highlight the three squares that caused the win."
